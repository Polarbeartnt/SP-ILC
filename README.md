We refered to yolov4-tiny implemented in Pytorch when writing the neural network, see https://github.com/bubbliiiing/yolov4-tiny-pytorch. 

The Test Results of Trained Patterns (sample rate in 333/4096 ~ 8.1%) on Double-and-Triple-MNIST and our Testset-80 is available in ``Simulation_Results/``. The Results of Random Patterns (sample rate in 333/4096 ~ 8.1%) on the data of our experiments are available in ``Experiment_Results/Testset-80/``.

The network, hyperparameters, and our self-made dataset will soon open accessed.
